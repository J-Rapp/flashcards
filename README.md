# Ruby Method Flashcards

Flashcard program that allows you to input Ruby methods and quiz yourself

## Some ideas for improvement

- "Syntax checker" method for card names, in order to verify correct user input and increase efficiency of the duplicate checking method
- Could create a column that provides examples, similar to the Ruby docs
